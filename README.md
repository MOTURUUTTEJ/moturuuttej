# 💫 About Me:
<br><br>---<br><br>### **Professional Summary**<br><br>I am a final-year Computer Science student and the **Software Team Leader at Avanthi Research Hub**, where I bridge the gap between **Full Stack Development** and **Computer Vision**. My technical expertise is grounded in building scalable web applications and engineering high-performance autonomous systems.<br><br>I have successfully led the development of an **autonomous search-and-rescue (SAR) drone**, utilizing **Python, OpenCV, and YOLOv10** to detect humans in disaster zones in real-time. Beyond research, I have built impactful software solutions, including a real-time **Cricket Player Auction System** and an **Autonomous Timetable Generator**, leveraging **JavaScript, Firebase, and Google Cloud**.<br><br>As an active hackathon winner and community leader, I thrive on solving complex, real-world problems and am currently seeking an **entry-level Software Engineering role** to apply my R&D and leadership experience to build impactful solutions.<br><br>---<br><br>### **Key Highlights for Your Profile**<br><br>**Technical Proficiencies:** Python, Java, JavaScript, YOLOv8/10, OpenCV, and Cloud platforms (Firebase, Supabase, GCP).<br>**Leadership:** Senior Software Leader at Avanthi Research Hub, managing interdisciplinary teams for technical challenges.<br>**Achievements:** 1st Place in College Hackathons and multiple awards in Code Debugging and Technical Quizzes.<br>**Specialization:** Integrating AI and Computer Vision with hardware like Raspberry Pi and Jetson Nano.<br><br>Professional Profile<br>I am a final-year Computer Science student and the Software Team Leader at Avanthi Research Hub. My expertise lies at the intersection of Full Stack Development and Computer Vision, where I build real-world solutions ranging from cloud-synced web applications to autonomous search-and-rescue systems.<br><br>🔭 I’m currently working on: Developing an autonomous search-and-rescue (SAR) drone that uses YOLOv10 and OpenCV on a Raspberry Pi to detect humans in disaster zones in real-time.<br><br><br>👯 I’m looking to collaborate on: Full-stack web applications using React.js or open-source projects focused on AI-driven health diagnostics and medical image processing.<br><br>🤝 I’m looking for help with advanced optimization techniques for Quantum Machine Learning models and securing fully-funded graduate study opportunities (M.Tech/MS) in Germany or Italy.<br><br>🌱 I’m currently learning: Docker and advanced cloud synchronization with Supabase and Firebase to enhance the scalability of my "ClassPulse AI" educational platform.<br><br>💬 Ask me about: Building real-time auction systems , implementing YOLO for object detection , or leading student research teams at Avanthi Research Hub.<br><br>⚡ Fun fact: I built a high-performance drone from scratch with zero prior knowledge in just six months.
